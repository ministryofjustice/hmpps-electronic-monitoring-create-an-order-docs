# Getting an account 

You’ll access the EMO online service using either a:    

- National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) or Digital Prison Service (DPS) account  

- username and password 

To get an account you need to:  

- check the onboarding timetable to find out when your team will start using the online service. You’ll get an account during onboarding  

- [set up an account](#new-joiners) if you are new and join a team that’s using the online service  


## New joiners  

You can get an account for a new team member if your team is already using the EMO online service.  

Do not create an account if your team is not using the EMO online service. Accounts are set up during onboarding.  

To set up an account for a new joiner: 

- contact Local System Administrator (LSA) if you are in the Prison Service  
  

## Removing access  

If someone leaves the team, you need to remove their access to the EMO online service.  

If your team hasn’t moved to using the EMO online service, you do not need to let us know that the person is leaving.  

To remove access: 

- contact the LSA if a person is leaving the Prison Service
