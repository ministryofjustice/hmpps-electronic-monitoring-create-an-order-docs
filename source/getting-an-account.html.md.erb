# Getting an account 

You’ll access the EMO online service using either a:    

- National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) or Digital Prison Service (DPS) account  

- username and password 


To get an account you need to:  

- check the onboarding timetable to find out when your team will start using the online service. You’ll get an account during onboarding  

- [set up an account](#new-joiners) if you are new and join a team that’s using the online service  


## New joiners  

Depending on which organisation you are from, here’s how you can can request access to the service:

Prisons (HMP & YOIs):

- if you are a Prison user, from either a HMP and/or YOI facility, you can request access to the service through your Local System Administrator (LSA)

- the LSA will provide you with the correct role, and a tile to access the service which will appear on the DPS Services Page 

Youth Custody Services (YCS):

- you will need to request access by completing a form, which you can request from your Team Manager, who is the nominated group admin for your organisation 

- your Team Manager will complete the form and submit this to the HMPPS Authentication Support Team to request the creation of a new account 
  

## Removing access  

If someone leaves the team, you need to remove their access to the EMO online service.

If your team hasn’t moved to using the EMO online service, you do not need to let us know that the person is leaving.

Prisons (HMP & YOIs):

- contact the LSA if a person is leaving the Prison Service and they can remove access 

Youth Custody Services (YCS):

- YCS manager will contact the HMPPS Authentication Support Team to request removal of access
