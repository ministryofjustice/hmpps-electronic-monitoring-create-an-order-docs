# Getting an account 

You’ll access the EMO online service using either a:    

- National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) or Digital Prison Service (DPS) account  

- Delius account 

- username and password 

To get an account you need to:  

- check the onboarding timetable to find out when your team will start using the online service. You’ll get an account during onboarding  

- [set up an account](##New-joiners) if you are new and join a team that’s using the online service  


## New joiners  

You can get an account for a new team member if your team is already using the EMO online service.  

Do not create an account if your team is not using the EMO online service. Accounts are set up during onboarding.  

To set up an account for a new joiner: 

- contact Local System Administrator (LSA) if you are in the Prison Service  

- raise a request on the [Delius Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b) if you are in the Probation Service    

- contact your nominated group administration manager if you are in Youth Custody Services, Courts or Home Office teams  

  

## Removing access  

If someone leaves the team, you need to remove their access to the EMO online service.  

If your team hasn’t moved to using the EMO online service, you do not need to let us know that the person is leaving.  

To remove access: 

- contact the LSA if a person is leaving the Prison service  

- complete the [amendment form on the Delius Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b) if a person is leaving the Probation Service  

- contact your group administration manager if a person is leaving the Youth Custody Services, Courts or Home Office 


## Group administration managers  

You need to remove access if a group administration manager is leaving. Email the [Product Support Team](product-support-team@digital.justice.gov.uk) to remove access.  

You must ensure that a new group administration manager is appointed.
