# Help if something goes wrong  

If something goes wrong an error message will show in red text or as a warning page. The information in the error message provides help so you can try to fix the problem. If you get an error message, follow the on-screen instructions and guidance.   

Error messages usually show when: 

- you haven't answered a mandatory question

- you have tried to upload a [file that isn't suitable due to size or file type](/New-EMO-application-forms%20.html#adding-attachments)

- there is a [technical problem](#technical-problems)  

- the form has [failed to submit](#form-failed-to-submit)   

- there is [planned maintenance](#planned-maintenance)   

- the [internet or server connection](#there-is-no-internet-connection)

- there is a [problem logging in](/logging-in.html)

If you don't get an on-screen error message but experience an issue using the online service, you can: 

- [report the problem](#report-a-problem) to the digital electronic monitoring support team

- attend a [drop-in session](/training-and-onboarding.html#drop-in-sessions)

- send a message in the Teams Support Channel (you will be added to this channel once your organisation is onboarded onto the new service)

- share [feedback](#feedback) to help improve the online service

If you have submitted a form but more information is needed, the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS) will contact you about their [query](#queries).  

## Technical problems  

If you get an error message due to technical issues, you need to log out and try again later.  

You'll find your application form saved in draft forms. Answers completed before the technical issue happened are saved.

If you return to the online service later and have the same problem, [report the problem](#report-a-problem). 

## Form failed to submit  

If you try to submit an EMO application form and get an error message, you need to: 

1. Click the link to download your completed form 

2. Save the downloaded form

3. Follow your team’s process for saving and storing documents.  

4. Email your download form and attachments to: 

- [EM Home Office Notification team](mailto:hoieorders@ems.co.uk) if you work at the Home Office 

- [EM Notification team](mailto:EMNotifications@ems.co.uk) if you work in any other service or department 

In your email explain what happened when you tried to submit your form using the online service. 

## Planned maintenance 

The online service is unavailable to use during planned maintenance. You will not be able to submit EMO applications during this time.  

Times and dates of planned maintenance will be communicated in advance. Maintenance will usually take place during quiet periods such as evenings and overnight to avoid disruption to you using the service. 

You are advised to plan submitting EMO application forms around when the service is unavailable.  

If you need to submit an urgent EMO application email:  

- [EM Home Office Notification team](mailto:hoieorders@ems.co.uk) if you work at the Home Office 

- [EM Notification team](mailto:EMNotifications@ems.co.uk) if you work in any other service or department 

In your email explain the situation so that the right support is offered. 

## There is no internet connection 

If the server or internet is down, you won't be able to use the online service. 

You need to follow your business continuity processes for when the internet or server is down.  

Speak to your line manager if you need help. 

## Report a problem 

If you experience an issue that you can’t fix, the digital electronic monitoring support team can help. 

To get help: 

- use the ‘report an issue’ link in the banner at the top of the screen when using the online service

- complete the [report the issue form](https://forms.office.com/e/czQvLP6DQq)

The digital electronic monitoring support team aim to respond within 1 working day after receiving your completed form.  

## Queries

EMS contact teams by email if they have a query about information submitted in a form. It may be that more information is required. 

The team email address EMS use is the one provided in the Contact information section under Organisation details. 

Ensure your team's contact details are correct when you add them to the application form as individual team members aren't contacted. 

## Feedback

Complete the [feedback form](https://forms.office.com/e/khDZBF1tCS) if you want to provide feedback on your experience using the service. It will take a few minutes to complete. 

The link to the feedback form is in the banner at the top of the screen when using the online service.

Your feedback is valued and will help make future improvements to the online service. 

You will not get a reply after you submit feedback. If you need a support with the problem use the [report the issue form](https://forms.office.com/e/czQvLP6DQq).
