## Logging in to your account

### How will I get a username and password?

Your login credentials to access the CEMO service will depend on which organisation you represent and submit orders from.

#### Prison employees

You can log in using your NOMIS or DPS credentials. [NOMIS credentials to log in]. If you do not have access to NOMIS, contact your Local System Administrator to raise a request... follow your usual business support model and contact the relevant HMPPS Auth Support teams to gain access.

#### Probation employee

You will need your [Delius credentials to log in]. If you do not have access to Delius, follow your usual business support model and contact the relevant HMPPS Auth Support teams to gain access.

#### Youth Custody Service, Court, and Home Office employees

Your username and password will be sent securely before you are onboarded to the service.

### Username or password isn't working

Your username and password are case-sensitive, so check:

- The spelling of your username and password is correct
- You are using uppercase and lowercase letters in the right place
- The caps lock is turned off when not needed

## Using the CEMO online service

### Services available

There are two services available:

1. **Submit a new electronic monitoring notification form**  
   Use this service to make a new request for electronic monitoring devices to be fitted. The person having the device fitted should not have any electronic monitoring in place at the time of submitting a request.

2. **Make changes to an existing electronic monitoring request**  
   Use this service to change and update details on a previously submitted electronic monitoring notification form. For example, to notify change of personal details or change monitoring conditions.

### What electronic monitoring can I request?

You can request electronic devices for:

- Trail monitoring
- Curfew
- Monitoring alcohol abstinence and alcohol levels
- Exclusion and inclusion zone monitoring
- Mandatory attendance monitoring

You can change or update monitoring conditions after you have submitted a notification form using the CEMO online service.

## Submitting a new CEMO form

### Creating a new CEMO form

Log in to your account and click on 'start new form'.

Follow instructions to complete the form.

### Completing the CEMO form

The form is separated into sections. Complete questions in each section before submitting the form.

We have provided helpful tips and guidance to complete questions with the correct information. To help you, there is also a reduction in free text boxes so you can select your answer on most questions. Additionally, based on your responses, you may be automatically skipped to the next question. For example, if the device wearer is over 18 years of age, you won't be asked to provide responsible adult details.

Some questions are mandatory as Serco require this information to install a device. Ensure you complete all mandatory questions on each page as you will not be able to move to the next page unless all mandatory questions are answered.

Some questions are optional, complete these questions if you have the necessary information. Optional questions are included as the information they collect is useful for Serco to have. They are optional because we are aware not all users will have access to the information required to answer the question.

We have highlighted if questions are for specific teams to answer. If you are not part of the named team on the question, you don't need to answer the question.

### Adding attachments

You will have an option to add attachments at the end of the online form. Files such as a copy of the licence or photo identification can be attached to the form.

Add files in the following formats:

- pdf
- png
- jpeg
- jpg

The file should not exceed 10mb in size.

### Saving a draft CEMO form

If you want to save the form in draft, you can click on the 'save and return to main form menu.' You will be directed to the CEMO online service homepage.

Your form will be saved and will show in the 'your draft forms' tab under the heading 'view and edit existing notification forms.' Forms are saved under the device wearer's name.

If you want to edit a draft form, find the device wearer's name and click on the name to open the form.
