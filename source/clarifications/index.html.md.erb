# Clarifications and queries on submitted forms

## Being contacted if there is a query

The process for Serco contacting teams for queries about submitted forms will stay the same.

Ensure your team's contact details are correct when you add them to the online form. These are the contact details Serco will use to contact your team.

## What can you change?

[Add section about what can be changed]

## Make a change process

If there is an error on your form or someone else's form:

- Search for the form
- Check it is the right form
- Click 'make changes'

[Add in section about what we can do]

## Fixing errors after submitting

If you have made an error on a submitted notification form, such as inputting incorrect information or a spelling mistake, use the online service to update your submitted form.

If Serco identifies an error, they will contact your team and update the error themselves.

## Making changes to forms submitted online

Search for the device wearer's name under the 'your submitted forms' tab. Click on the device wearer's name to edit the form and resubmit.

## Making changes to forms previously submitted by email

If your notification form was submitted by email before you were onboarded to the online service or because of a problem submitting your form online, it will not show under the 'your submitted forms' tab. You won't have an online form to edit, so instead create a new notification form with the updated details.

## Ending monitoring

Search for the form, click on 'end'.

## When not to use the online service

There are situations where you do not need to use the online service:

- **You haven't been told to move to using the online service**  
  You must continue to follow existing processes and email completed forms to <lpadmin@ems.co.uk>.

- **If you are onboarded and the online service is down or not working**  
  If you try to access the online form and it fails to load or you submit a form and receive a failure to submit error message, follow the below processes:

  - [For when the online service is unavailable]
  - [Emailing completed forms that failed to submit](#form-failed-to-submit-online)
  - When the internet is down

1. Click the link to download your completed form.
2. Save the downloaded form. Follow your team's process for safely and securely storing documents.

4. Create a new email as follows:
   - Write [(subject line)] as the subject line.
   - Attach the completed form.

   - In the body of the email, explain why you are emailing the form (e.g., the form failed to submit when you used the online form or the online form is not working).
   - Include your team contact details and team email address so we can contact you if there are any problems.
5. Send email to:

- <hoieorders@ems.co.uk> if you work at the Home Office.
- <EMNotifications@ems.co.uk> if you work in any other service or department.

Explain in your email that the attachments did not send and provide details of what form the attachments belong to.

## Why we are moving to an online service

### The need for a digital service

The aim of the EMO online service is for users to find it easy to submit a request for electronic monitoring devices to be installed, as well as ensuring all required information is collected to reduce the need for clarification processes.

Through creating an online form, we can ensure all information required by EMS and the installer is collected, reducing the need for clarification of information processes after the forms are submitted.

The EMO Product Team also found they could improve the overall user experience of submitting information. The EMO online service consolidates all request forms into one online version with improvements made to the process of collecting data, data processing, and simplifying the language used throughout the form.

### Designing an EMO online service

The EMO Product Team have carried out extensive research to design a form that collects essential information required to install electronic monitoring devices.

They have digitised the process and improved the user experience of submitting information to generate an order to ensure a device is installed or change monitoring conditions on a device already installed.

They have worked with key teams involved in the installation and notification process to ensure we collect all data required to install devices. You may find that some questions have been removed or added due to this research.
