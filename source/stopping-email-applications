# Stopping emailing EMO applications 

When you have an account to use the online service, you need to use it for EMO applications unless there is [an issue using the service](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-create-an-order-docs/blob/Update-setting-up-an-account/source/Help-when-something-goes-wrong.html.md.erb). 

If you don't have an account, [view the onboarding timetable](source/training-and-onboarding.html.md.erb) to find out when your team is due to start using the online service or [create an account](source/getting-an-account.html.md.erb).   


## Why stop emailing EMO applications? 

It is important to use the online service because:  

- all forms submitted via the online service are saved  

- you and other users can view and make changes to it  

You should not email EMO application forms because:  

- application forms aren't uploaded or stored on the online service   

- you and others will not be able to view the application form on the online service 

- it will not show up in search results so other users won’t be clear on whether an application form was submitted   

- you can’t make changes to or end monitoring easily using the application form  

- it will take longer to make changes or end monitoring as you will need to start a new form   

- older document versions of forms are no longer in use. They don't collect all the information needed. This will cause a delay to installation as you’ll need to provide more information 

There may be exceptional circumstances where you need to submit an EMO application form another way, if the situation arises you will get instructions on what to do. View the examples of some situations when this can happen in the [Help when something goes wrong](source/Help-when-something-goes-wrong.html.md.erb) section.



## Should I email if I can’t submit a form online? 

If you have a problem submitting an EMO application form, we have support available on what to do.   

To know what to do, you can:  

 - follow the steps on the [error message](source/Help-when-something-goes-wrong.html.md.erb) within the online service if you have one   

- [report the issue form](https://forms.office.com/e/czQvLP6DQq) to ask for support  

- attend a [drop-in session](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-create-an-order-docs/blob/Update-setting-up-an-account/source/training-and-onboarding.html.md.erb)   

- follow the [help and support guidance](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-create-an-order-docs/blob/Update-setting-up-an-account/source/Help-when-something-goes-wrong.html.md.erb)
 
Do not complete old Microsoft Word or PDF versions of the EMO application form. The questions and data collected has changed, so they will not provide all the information needed for installation.    
   



## Accessing forms already submitted by email 

Copies of emailed forms are not uploaded to the online service. This means that they will not come up in search results as they are not stored on the online service.  

If you need to view an EMO application was submitted by email:  

- [EM Home Office Notification team](mailto:hoieorders@ems.co.uk) if you work at the Home Office 

- [EM Notification team](mailto:EMNotifications@ems.co.uk) if you work in any other service or department 

To make changes or end monitoring you need to submit a new application form via the online service.
