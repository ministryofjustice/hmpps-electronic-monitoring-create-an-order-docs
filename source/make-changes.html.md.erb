# Making changes

You can make changes, or a variation, to a submitted EMO form using the online service. You can change EMO forms submitted by yourself or someone else.

You can:

- Make changes to an EMO form that has been submitted using the online service.
- Submit changes to EMO forms sent by email to EMS.
- Remove all electronic devices and end all monitoring conditions early.

## Make a change

You can change:

- Personal details of the device wearer, including addresses.
- Responsible adult details.
- Monitoring conditions, including adding or removing monitoring conditions and updating existing monitoring conditions.
- Attachments by uploading new licenses, maps of exclusion zones, and photo identification.

To make a change to an EMO form submitted using the online service:

1. Enter the device wearer's name or date of birth in the search bar.
2. Find the device wearer's submitted EMO in the search results.
3. Click on the device wearer's name to check if it is the correct EMO form. Check personal details as there may be more than one device wearer with the same name.
4. Click 'make changes' and follow the instructions to make and submit changes.

## Ending all monitoring early

You can remove all electronic monitoring devices and end all monitoring conditions. Use this process if you need to:

- Stop all monitoring conditions.
- End monitoring before the end date on the submitted EMO form.

Use the make a change process if you need to change a monitoring end date but not end all monitoring.

You do not need to submit an end-of-monitoring request if the end dates are correct on the submitted form. EMS will remove electronic monitoring devices on the end date provided.

To end all monitoring:

1. Click on the device wearer's name to edit the form.
2. Check the details on the form to ensure it is the right form.
3. Click 'end.'
4. Follow the instructions to submit your request.

## Fixing errors on forms

Use the make a change process to correct spelling mistakes and incorrect information.

If EMS finds an error or needs more information, they will contact your team by email.

## Form not found in search

Forms submitted by email are not uploaded to the online service. This includes forms submitted by email before onboarding. They won't appear in search results.

Check spelling and inputted dates to ensure they are correct when searching. If the form you are looking for does not appear in search results, follow the on-screen instructions. You need to complete all sections of the form to submit a change.

It is important to always use the online service so there is a form in the online service to make changes to.
