#Frequently asked questions


##Access & Onboarding 

**Do I need to request EMO access on the DPS main page?** 

No. The EMO tile will appear automatically for Prison users from 22 July 2025 and Youth users from October 2025. If you don't have access, request it via your Local System Administrator.  

**Where can I access the EMO tile on DPS?** 

You should have access to the EMO tile on the DPS Services Page. 

**When should I start using the EMO service?** 

From 22 July 2025, all Prison users will be onboarded. From October 2025 all Youth users will be onboarded. Use the service from your onboarding date. 

**Do I need to use the EMO service even if I’m busy with other initiatives?**

Yes. The service is mandatory from your onboarding date. Support is available via Microsoft Teams and the weekly drop-ins (1–1:30pm). 



##Order Submission Guidance 

**How do I know if an order has been accepted?**

You will receive a successful submission message on the service when you have successfully submitted an order. This will act as a receipt that your order has been sent to the installer, and you will not receive email confirmation. However, you will not receive confirmation from the installer if an order has been successfully processed. You will hear from the installer  if an order has been rejected or requires more information, where you will then be instructed on what to do in order to resubmit an order.  

**Will the service block orders for ineligible individuals (e.g. Parole Board releases)?**

No. The system does not check eligibility before submission. The installer  will review all orders and reject those that don’t meet criteria. It is the Prison’s responsibility to check eligibility before submitting. 


##Address Requirements & Responsibilities 

**Often an address is not provided until close to the release date. Can I submit an order without an address?**

No, an address must be provided. The only exception for no addresses is for Alcohol Monitoring. For Alcohol Monitoring Install At Source enables installation of monitoring equipment at Prison and Probation offices.  

**What if Probation doesn’t provide a release address?**

An address is required for EM orders. Only AM orders can be submitted without a fixed address. For Acquisitive Crime cases, Probation must submit the order via email if no address is available. 

**If no address is available before release, does Probation submit the order after release?**

Yes, for AM and Acquisitive Crime orders. Otherwise, EM orders require an address at release and will be rejected without one. 


##Attachments 

**Can I attach documentation such as licences and exclusion zone maps?** 

Yes. Exclusion zone maps can be attached in the relevant field is ‘Exclusion Zone Monitoring’ is selected on the Electronic Monitoring requirements page.  

You can also attach a copy of the licence in the ‘Additional documents’ page. You cannot submit an order without a licence.

**A licence is often approved just before release. Is less than 48 hours’ notice acceptable?**

Yes. EMS will process the order upon receipt if all details are correct. Include as much information as possible, including the updated licence. 

**Probation requests tagging after someone leaves the Approved Premises. Who submits the order?**

Probation is responsible. Once onboarded, they can amend orders raised by Prisons, including adding addresses. 

**Should Community Offender Managers (COMs) complete the forms instead of Prisons?**

No. There is no change to responsibilities. Probation provides the information, and Prisons complete the EM Order. 

**Who is responsible for providing information for 2-day checks in high churn remand prisons?**

Probation must provide the required information via CVL or HDC platforms. Prisons must work with Probation to ensure EM eligibility (address required at release). 


##Immigration & Bail Orders 

**Our tagging is mostly for Immigration Bail. Will this change with EMO?**

No. EMO is currently for licence cases only. Immigration cases are not yet supported. Home Office staff will continue using their current process (e.g. Atlas system). Any immigration cases must be submitted by the Home Office.   

**For Foreign National Offenders transferred to IRCs, how is DAPOL monitoring handled?**

Home Office (HOIE hub) raises these orders and contacts the Prison. Prisons do not raise these orders. 

**What if a prisoner is released from an IRC and no one is informed in time to submit a form?**

If held in an IRC post-release, licence conditions apply only after they leave. Home Office should inform the Prison to submit the EM order if applicable. 


##Form Distribution  

**Will the EMO form be sent to Probation, Police, or other agencies automatically?**

No. You must manually send the form to relevant cohorts and agencies. Download the form after submission and email it as needed to relevant agencies or cohorts, such as Probation and Police. If you do, please remind recipients that they DO NOT need to send this to EMS as this will risk creating a duplicate.  

**Who updates curfew or address info post-release for HDC orders?**

Probation is responsible. They will use the email process until onboarded. 


##Search and change 

**Can I search submitted forms and reuse data for changes?**

Yes, you can search forms that have been submitted by you and other individuals in your cohort. To find these submissions, click the ‘Submitted forms’ tab on your dashboard and search for the device wearer. You can search by device wearer’s first name and/or last name or personal identity number entered on the original order. For example, their NOMIS number.  

**Can I edit submitted orders and amend individual fields?** 

Yes, you can change orders that have been submitted by searching for them, viewing them and clicking the 'Make changes to this form' button.

**Will future updates auto-fill prisoner info from DPS/NOMIS?**

This is being explored but not expected soon. Updates will be communicated. 


##Staggered curfew

**How do I submit an order with a staggered curfew?**

You need to first submit an order with the curfew hours at the time of release.

You then need to submit a change to that order with the new curfew hours and the date of that change.

You need to repeat this for all the different curfew times.


##Miscellaneous 

**Does the EMO service cover Scottish releases?**

No. The installer does not provide EM in Scotland. Continue submitting these requests to the Scottish EM provider via your existing email process. 

**Does the EMO service cover the MOPAC pathfinder?**

No. The installer does not provide EM for the MOPAC pathfinder.

MOPAC/Buddi tags are only available to cases coming out of prison and back to London and this is accessed via a referral from probation, rather than anyone in the prisons.
 
The COM should contact [MOPAC probation team](mailto:londonps.buddigps@justice.gov.uk) and they can check if cases are eligible and support referrals as needed.

**What do I do if there is a MOPAC GPS requirement but also another monitoring type**

MOPAC are responsible for the GPS tag. The COM should contact [MOPAC probation team](mailto:londonps.buddigps@justice.gov.uk) and they can check if cases are eligible and support referrals as needed.

Contact [Electronic Monitoring Support](mailto:digitalmonitoringqueries@justice.gov.uk) for guidance on how to raise an order for the other monitoring type. For example, Alcohol Monitoring. 


##Rejections and what to do next?  

Rejections of orders are to be expected, as often there are mistakes made or information missing that is required to process the order. Below are the types of rejections commonly experienced by users on the new service. Please find information on what to do to avoid rejections, and what to do if you have a rejection.  

**Submitting a change to an order after a rejection**

If you have an order rejected, you should:

- Go into the EMO service and search for your order by device wearer’s first name and/or last name or personal identity number entered on the original order

- Follow the steps to make a change to the order

- Select 'Yes' to the question 'Are you making changes to this form because the original was rejected by email?' 

- Rectify the issues as stated in the email and submit -  - this is now quicker and easier to do, and you can edit the fields you need without needing to start a blank form 

**Licence attachments**

It is mandatory to attach the licence, and the service now prohibits users from submitting an order without attaching the licence in the documentation page. There have been instances where users have uploaded incorrect documents in the licence field. Make sure you upload the correct licence for the device wearer you are raising an order for, otherwise it will be rejected and a resubmission requested.  

**Pilots: not selecting the right pilot**

Serco require the pilot information so that they can ensure the correct procedure is followed when the device wearer is being electronically monitored. 

There have been several cases where the pilot question has been answered incorrectly or the option 'They are not part of any pilots' has been selected when the device wearer is part of a pilot. This has resulted in the order being rejected by Serco. 

We know that users don't always know if the device wearer is part of a pilot. However, to avoid your order being rejected you need to find this information. 

Where to find out if the device wearer is part of a pilot: 

- Ask the COM 

- In the 'Create and vary a licence' service. This is at the bottom of the page where you print the licence. Pilot information will not be printed on the licence itself. 

**Incorrect dates**

Some orders have been rejected due to incorrect order start and order end dates. You should always double check the dates provided on the order are aligned with those outlined on the licence.  

If the dates are wrong on the licence contact the COM to get the licence changed before submitting the order. For example, trail monitoring can't continue past the HDC end date unless the device wearer is on a pilot.

**Ineligible monitoring types on the licence** 

If certain monitoring options are unavailable in EMO, it means the individual is not eligible for those conditions. 
 
If the licence includes monitoring conditions the device wearer is not eligible for, the licence must be corrected before you submit the order. 

**Ineligible alcohol monitoring conditions on the licence**

For alcohol monitoring orders, the licence must have either alcohol abstinence or alcohol level monitoring.  

If the licence includes both alcohol monitoring conditions, the licence must be corrected before you submit the order. 

**Licence conditions not stated to be electronically monitored**

Some licences include an exclusion zone (For example, the device wearer must not enter Bristol town centre) or a curfew. 

These will not be monitored by the EM provider unless the licence specifically states that they are to be electronically monitored. 
 
Check the electronic monitoring paragraph 14a in the licence to confirm what conditions are to be electronically monitored.  

If the electronic monitoring paragraph does not mention electronic monitoring of the condition, do not select it in EMO. 

_14a) Allow person(s) as designated by your supervising officer to install an electronic monitoring tag on you and access to install any associated equipment in your property, and for the purpose of ensuring that equipment is functioning correctly. You must not damage or tamper with these devices and ensure that the tag is charged, and report to your supervising officer and the EM provider immediately if the tag or the associated equipment are not working correctly. This will be for the purpose of monitoring your [INSERT TYPES OF CONDITIONS HERE (e.g., exclusion, trail, curfew, alcohol monitoring…) TO BE ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED] licence condition(s) unless otherwise authorised by your supervising officer._ 

**Multiple electronic monitored conditions on the licence**

You must check which conditions are in the electronic monitoring paragraph 14a of the licence. See the FAQ above for an example of paragraph 14a. 

If the licence requests multiple types of electronic monitoring, make sure all of these are added to the EMO order.
