#Frequently asked questions


##Access & Onboarding 

**Do I need to request EMO access on the DPS main page?** 

No. The EMO tile will appear automatically for Prison users from 22 July 2025, if your NOMIS ID and email were shared with the EM Change Team by 17 July 2025. Otherwise, if you haven’t add access, request access via your Local System Administrator.  

**Where can I access the EMO tile on DPS?** 

You should have access to the EMO tile on the DPS Services Page. It should appear as per the image below. If there’s  

**When should I start using the EMO service?** 

From 22 July 2025, all prisons will be onboarded, with the exception of Youth Offender Institutions (YOIs) who will be onboarded later this year (dates TBC). Use the service from your onboarding date. 

**Do I need to use the EMO service even if I’m busy with other initiatives?**

Yes. The service is mandatory from your onboarding date. Support is available via Microsoft Teams and the bi-weekly drop-ins (1–1:30pm). 

**I have a tagged release before onboarding. Should I wait to use the EMO service?**

If the order must be raised before onboarding, use the existing process. If onboarding occurs before the release, use EMO. 


##Order Submission Guidance 

**How do I know if an order has been accepted?**

You will receive a successful submission message on the service when you have successfully submitted an order. This will act as a receipt that your order has been sent to Serco, and you will not receive email confirmation. However, you will not receive confirmation from Serco if an order has been successfully processed. You will hear from Serco if an order has been rejected or requires more information, where you will then be instructed on what to do in order to resubmit an order.  

**What if the system doesn’t accept Alcohol Monitoring orders?**

For orders with Alcohol Monitoring (AM), use the email process: LPAdmin@EMS.co.uk. For orders without AM, use EMO. Currently the service does not offer AM as a monitoring requirement, so if you have any orders to raise with AM or AM and an additional monitoring, you should submit this over email to LPAdmin.  

**For HDC with Alcohol Monitoring, should I split the order between EMO and email?**

No. Submit all AM-related orders via email until AM is supported in EMO. 

**When will Alcohol Monitoring be available in EMO?**

Timing is TBC. The EM Business Change Team will notify you. 

**Will the service block orders for ineligible individuals (e.g. Parole Board releases)?**

No. The system does not check eligibility before submission. Serco will review all orders and reject those that don’t meet criteria. It is the Prison’s responsibility to check eligibility before submitting. 


##Address Requirements & Responsibilities 

**Often an address is not provided until close to the release date. Can I submit an order without an address?**

No, an address must be provided. The only exception for no addresses will be when Alcohol Monitoring is implemented in the service (timings TBC). Tag At Source will eventually be implemented into the service which will cater for installations of some devices at Prison and Probation offices.  

**What if Probation doesn’t provide a release address?**

An address is required for EM orders. Only AM orders can be submitted without a fixed address (via email). For Acquisitive Crime cases, Probation must submit the order via email if no address is available. 

**If no address is available before release, does Probation submit the order after release?**

Yes, for AM and Acquisitive Crime orders. Otherwise, EM orders require an address at release and will be rejected without one. 


##Attachments 

**Can I attach documentation such as licences and exclusion zone maps?** 

Yes. Exclusion zone maps can be attached in the relevant field is ‘Exclusion Zone Monitoring’ is selected on the Electronic Monitoring requirements page.  

**You can also attach a copy of the licence in the ‘Additional documents’ page. You cannot submit an order without a licence.**

**A licence is often approved just before release. Is less than 48 hours’ notice acceptable?**

Yes. EMS will process the order upon receipt if all details are correct. Include as much information as possible, including the updated licence. 

**Probation requests tagging after someone leaves the Approved Premises. Who submits the order?**

Probation is responsible. Once onboarded, they can amend orders raised by Prisons, including adding addresses. 

**Should Community Offender Managers (COMs) complete the forms instead of Prisons?**

No. There is no change to responsibilities. Probation provides the information, and Prisons complete the EM Order. 

**Who is responsible for providing information for 2-day checks in high churn remand prisons?**

Probation must provide the required information via CVL or HDC platforms. Prisons must work with Probation to ensure EM eligibility (address required at release). 


##Immigration & Bail Orders 

**Our tagging is mostly for Immigration Bail. Will this change with EMO?**

No. EMO is currently for licence cases only. Immigration cases are not yet supported. Home Office staff will continue using their current process (e.g. Atlas system). Any immigration cases must be submitted by the Home Office.   

**For Foreign National Offenders transferred to IRCs, how is DAPOL monitoring handled?**

Home Office (HOIE hub) raises these orders and contacts the Prison. Prisons do not raise these orders. 

**What if a prisoner is released from an IRC and no one is informed in time to submit a form?**

If held in an IRC post-release, licence conditions apply only after they leave. Home Office should inform the Prison to submit the EM order if applicable. 


##Form Distribution  

**Will the EMO form be sent to Probation, Police, or other agencies automatically?**

No. You must manually send the form to relevant cohorts and agencies. Download the form after submission and email it as needed to relevant agencies or cohorts, such as Probation and Police. If you do, please remind recipients that they DO NOT need to send this to EMS/Serco as this will risk creating a duplicate.  

**Who updates curfew or address info post-release for HDC orders?**

Probation is responsible. They will use the email process until onboarded. 


##Search and change 

**Can I search submitted forms and reuse data for changes?**

Yes, you can search forms that have been submitted by you and other individuals in your cohort. To find these submissions, click the ‘search submitted form’ button and type the first name and last name of the device wearer. E.g. ‘John Smith’.  

**Why can I not edit submitted orders and amend individual fields?** 

This functionality is not yet available in the EMO service. We acknowledge that this would make the process of submitting orders with changes much easier for you as users, so this is something that is being explored. Until then, please enter the information again and specify the changes that you have made.  

**Will future updates auto-fill prisoner info from DPS/NOMIS?**

This is being explored but not expected soon. Updates will be communicated. 


##Miscellaneous 

**Who qualifies as a “Youth” in this service?**

If released under a Youth sentence (e.g. DTO), use existing forms and submit over email to LPAdmin@EMS.co.uk until CEMO is rolled out. 

**Does the EMO service cover Scottish releases?**

No. Serco does not provide EM in Scotland. Continue submitting these requests to the Scottish EM provider via your existing email process. 


##Rejections and what to do next?  

Rejections of orders are to be expected, as often there are mistakes made or information missing that is required to process the order. Below are the types of rejections commonly experienced by users on the new service. Please find information on what to do to avoid rejections, and what to do if you have a rejection.  

**Licence attachments**

It is mandatory to attach the licence, and the service now prohibits users from submitting an order without attaching the licence in the documentation page. There have been instances where users have uploaded incorrect documents in the licence field. Make sure you upload the correct licence for the device wearer you are raising an order for, otherwise it will be rejected and a resubmission requested.  

**Orders contain Alcohol Monitoring requirements** 

The EMO Service does not yet process orders containing any Alcohol Monitoring requirements. If you have either a standalone AM order, or an AM Order with additional monitoring (e.g. AM and Curfew), you must submit this over email to LPAdmin@EMS.co.uk until further notice. You should not submit part of the order on EMO, everything must be submitted over email.  

**Submitting a variation after a rejection**

Currently, when you have an order rejected, Serco request that a NEW ORDER is raised on EMO, rather than an order raised on search and change. If you have an order rejected, you should create a new order on the service. If you have to make a change to an order that has been raised and processed successfully (e.g. change address or add a monitoring requirement), then you can request to make a change to a submitted order.  

This process is currently being reviewed and worked on by the EMO team to improve your experience on the service. However, until further notice, you should follow the above guidance.  

**Pilots: not selecting the right pilot**

Serco require the pilot information so that they can ensure the correct procedure is followed when the device wearer is being electronically monitored. 

There have been several cases where the pilot question has been answered incorrectly or the option 'They are not part of any pilots' has been selected when the device wearer is part of a pilot. This has resulted in the order being rejected by Serco. 

We know that users don't always know if the device wearer is part of a pilot. However, to avoid your order being rejected you need to find this information. 

Where to find out if the device wearer is part of a pilot: 

- Ask the COM 

- In the 'Create and vary a licence' service. This is at the bottom of the page where you print the licence (see screenshot below). Pilot information will not be printed on the licence itself. 

**No address provided**

Many orders are being rejected because an address is not provided. While it’s possible to include an order with ‘No Fixed Address’, this will be changed soon. If you submit any order currently without an address, it will be rejected.  

We are aware that often addresses are not provided by Probation up until the release date, however it is still best to wait for this information before raising an order.  

The only exception for no addresses will be when Alcohol Monitoring is implemented in the service. Tag At Source will eventually be implemented into the service which will cater for installations of some devices at Prison and Probation offices.  

**Incorrect dates**

Some orders have been rejected due to incorrect order start and order end dates. You should always double check the dates provided on the order are aligned with thise outlined on the licence.  

**Incorrect monitoring**

Some orders have been rejected due to not having all the monitoring types that are on the licence. 

If you have an order with several monitoring types, for example Trail and Curfew, check you have added them all.
