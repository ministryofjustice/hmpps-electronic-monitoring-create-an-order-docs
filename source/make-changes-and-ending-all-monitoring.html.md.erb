# Making changes and ending all monitoring 

You can make changes, or a variation, to a submitted EMO application form using the online service. 

You can make changes to EMO application forms submitted by yourself or someone else.

You must change the licence or court order first before making changes to the EMO application form. 

You can:

- [make changes to an EMO application form](#making-changes-to-online-forms) that has been submitted using the online service
- submit changes to [EMO application forms sent by email](#making-changes-to-forms-submitted-by-email)
- remove all electronic devices and [end all monitoring conditions early](#ending-all-monitoring-early)

You can change any details within the application form, such as:

- personal details of the device wearer, including addresses
- responsible adult details
- monitoring conditions, including adding or removing monitoring conditions and updating existing monitoring conditions
- attachments by uploading new licenses, maps of exclusion zones, and photo identification

## Making changes to online forms

To make a change to an EMO application form submitted using the online service:

1. Enter the device wearer's name or identity number in the search bar
2. Find the device wearer's submitted EMO in the search results
3. Click on the device wearer's name to check if it is the correct EMO form. Check personal details as there may be more than one device wearer with the same name
4. Click 'make changes' and follow the instructions to make and submit changes

## Making changes to forms submitted by email

To make a change to an [EMO application form submitted by email](/stopping-email-applications.html#accessing-forms-already-submitted-by-email):

1. Enter the device wearer's name or identity number in the search bar
2. Check search results to ensure there is no EMO application form for the device wearer on the online service 
  - if there is no result for the device wearer, follow the link in the search results to 'tell us about a change to a form sent by email'
  - if there is a result for the device wearer, follow the [make a change to an online EMO application form](#making-changes-to-online-forms) process 


## Ending all monitoring early

You can remove all electronic monitoring devices and end all monitoring conditions. Use this process if you need to:

- stop all monitoring conditions
- end all monitoring before the previously submitted end date

You do not need to submit an end-of-monitoring request if the end dates are correct on the submitted form. EMS will remove electronic monitoring devices on the end date provided.

To end all monitoring early email LPAdmin@EMS.co.uk with details of the order you want to end. 

This should include:

- device wearer's full name
- device wearer's date of birth
- device wearer's personal identity numbers (for example, NOMIS number)
- main offence committed by the device wearer
- start date of monitoring
- end date of monitoring
