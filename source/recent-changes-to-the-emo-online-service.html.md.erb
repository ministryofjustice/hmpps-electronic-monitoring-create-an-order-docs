# Recent changes to the EMO online service 

### Improvements to monitoring types
You now will only add one monitoring type at a time and then will be asked if you want to add any other types.
A number of orders have been rejected because there were multiple monitoring types on the licence but only one was added on the EMO form.  By adding one at a time makes it easier to focus on the conditions for that type. By asking if you want to add another type prompts you to check you have them all.

## November 2025 

### Audit history

You can now view a history of changes to an order. This includes when the change was made and by whom.

Previously you could only view the most recent version of an order.

### Installation at another address when device wearer has no fixed address

If a device wearer has no fixed address, you can now choose a different location—such as a grandparent’s home—for installing Alcohol Monitoring equipment and tags.

### EMAC not eligible pages

You can now clearly see what you need to do if the device wearer has not commited an eligible EMAC offence and is not living in an in-scope police force area.

Previously it was not clear what you had to do when the device wearer was not eligible for the EMAC pilot.

### Language question improvements

You now only need to answer the language question if you select the device wearer needs a translator.

Previously it was not clear that these questions were related.

### Overall monitoring dates

You no longer need to enter the overall monitoring dates.

Previously, you had to enter dates for each monitoring condition as well as the overall dates, which was time-consuming and often led to rejections when the dates didn’t match.

### Improvements to monitoring types

You now will only add one monitoring type at a time and then will be asked if you want to add any other types.

A number of orders have been rejected because there were multiple monitoring types on the licence but only one was added on the EMO form.  By adding one at a time makes it easier to focus on the conditions for that type. By asking if you want to add another type prompts you to check you have them all.

### Improvements to monitoring details

You’ll see one question per page instead of several and only relevant options will appear based on the type of order you’re raising. For example, For Extended Determinate Sentences, questions about Home Detention Curfews (HDC) and Pilots will no longer appear.

Pilot eligibility checks have also been built into the new page flow. For example, if you have selected a Probation region that is not eligible for the DAPOL pilot, you will not be able to select the DAPOL pilot. You will now be able to use the device wearer’s postcode to check that they are in an eligible police area for the GPS Acquisitive Crime (EMAC) pilot and that they have committed an eligible offence.

## October 2025 

### Alcohol Monitoring 

You can now select Alcohol Monitoring as a requirement within an order on the EM online service. 

All Alcohol Monitoring orders must be submitted via the service, rather than email.  

For Alcohol Monitoring you can also select that installation should be at a prison or probation office rather than the device wearer's home address.

### Probation Delivery Units 

You will now be requested to provide additional details on the individual Probation Delivery Unit in charge of monitoring device wearers. 

This is a new page that will appear if ‘Probation’ is selected as the Responsible Organisation on the contact information page.  

### Additional fields  

New fields have been added to the service, including: 

- Additional offence details (freetext field on the risk information page to provide further details on an individual offence) 

- Curfew address boundary (additional page to capture details of the curfew boundary)


## September 2025 

### Search and change

You can now search for and change an order submitted by you or another user.

Previously if you were making a change you had to enter all the information again. You can now search for the form and just edit the things that have changed.

### Rejected forms

You can now search for and change an order that you submitted and Serco rejected.

Previously if you were making a change to a rejected form you had to enter all the information again. You can now search for the form and just edit the things that were wrong.

### Improved dashboard

You can now view your draft forms and search for forms submitted by you or any other user directly from the dashboard.

There has been feedback that users were not finding the search and wanted a quick any easy way to find forms submitted by them or other users.

### Improved search

You can now search by any combination of surname, first name or personal identity number.

Previously you had to search by full name. Users need to just search by surname or personal identity number to ensure they can find what they are looking for.

## August 2025 

### Trail monitoring

You will now have clearer help text when selecting trail monitoring as a monitoring type.

There has been feedback that the previous text mentioned acquisitive crime and users were not confident selecting it when the device wearer was not part of this pilot.

### Pilot question

You will now have help text on the pilot question on where to find if the device wearer is part of a pilot.

EM need the pilot information so that they can ensure the correct procedure is followed when the device wearer is being electronically monitored.

There has been feedback that users don't always know this information.

### No fixed address

If the device wearer has no fixed address you will only be able to select Alcohol monitoring as a monitoring type. However, currently alcohol monitoring is not yet available in the service so you will not be able to complete an order without a fixed address.

A fixed address is required to process all monitoring orders apart from those that include Alcohol monitoring.  For Acquisitive Crime (EMAC) orders with no fixed address at release, probation are responsible for raising the order once an address is confirmed.

### Installation address

You will no longer have to select what address the monitoring equipment will be installed at.

The installation address will always be the device wearer's fixed address unless the tag is getting fitted at the prison prior to release. 

### Licence

You will now have to upload a licence when submitting the form.

There has been feedback that forms were getting rejected without a licence attached. EMS can't process the order without a license, so wait to submit it until you have one — even if that means giving them less than 48 hours' notice.

### Exclusion zone maps

You will now be able to upload PNG's when you are adding a map to an exclusion zone.

There has been feedback that some maps are in PNG format and users were unable to upload them.

### Navigation

You will now be able to quickly check the form is correct before you submit it.

When all sections of the form are complete you will now be able to use the 'Save and go to the next section' button on the 'Check your answers' page to move to the next section's 'Check your answers' page.

## July 2025 

### Device wearer fixed address

You will now be able to see improved help text when selecting if a device wearer has a fixed address.

In most cases a fixed address is needed to process the order. If you submit an order without it your order may be rejected.

### Licence upload

You will now be able to upload larger files and Word documents when attaching a licence to an order. 
 
There has been feedback that people need to upload files bigger than 10MB so the limit has been increased to 25MB. In addition you will now be able to upload Word documents in addition to PDFs.

### Change a submitted order

The 'About the changes in this version of the form' has been updated to remove the different options that were available to select for what had changed in an order.  
 
This list of options was not fully representative of what could be changed in the form. Details of what is being changed in the order should now only be captured in the freetext box.

You can also now enter more information about of what you have changed in a text box.

This text will be sent with your changes to help the installer quickly understand what has changed and what they need to do. 

There have also been some changes to make it more obvious that you are sending a change to an order rather than a new order.

### Monitoring details

The 'Order type' field has been removed so that you do not have to select 'Post-release'. This is automatically selected for you, so it is no longer visible on the page.

The options for the question; 'Which pilot is the device wearer part of?' have been updated to make it easier to provide the relevant details.

Some options for the condition type question have been removed so now it only includes 'Licence conditions' and 'Post-sentence supervision requirement'.

### Search for a submitted order

You can now search for a form that you or somebody else has submitted by clicking the ‘Search submitted form’ button on the homescreen page.

You need to see forms that you or other people have submitted, depending on your organisation's access. In future releases you will be able to make a change to a form that you or other people have submitted.

## June 2025 

### Removing start time and end time of monitoring

You no longer need to enter the overall start time and end time of monitoring. 

There has been feedback that you don’t always know the start and end times and they are not on the licence. The installer will use 00:00 for the start time on the day monitoring starts and 23:59 for the end time on the day monitoring ends.

### Making overall end date of monitoring mandatory

You can no longer submit an EMO form without entering the overall end date of monitoring. 

Monitoring end date is needed by the installer to ensure monitoring stops at that date. It can be found on the licence.

### Making end date of monitoring for each monitoring requirement mandatory

You can no longer submit an EMO form without entering the end date for each monitoring requirement that is added. For example, Trail monitoring.

End dates are needed by the installer to ensure monitoring stops at that date. They can be found on the licence for each monitoring requirement.

### Splitting risk information question

You now need to check if there are any alerts against the device wearer and record that information in the form. If you know of any known risks at the installation address you should also select the appropriate option. 

There has been feedback that you won't always know about risks at the installation address such as dangerous animals but do know about any alerts against the device wearer such as violent behaviour. To make it easier for you to answer the risk question has been split into two questions in the service. 

### Improvement to installation address page to enable easy selection of device wearers fixed address

You can now select the device wearer’s fixed address to use as the address where installation of the electronic monitoring device will take place. 

There has been feedback that it was time consuming and onerous to manually enter the same address twice. You will now be able to select the device wearer’s address for the installation address.

### Download PDF
You can now download a PDF of your submitted form directly from the download button on the summary page.

You often need to download a copy of the form for your records and to send it to probation and police. The old process of printing to PDF and then saving that PDF was not intuitive.
