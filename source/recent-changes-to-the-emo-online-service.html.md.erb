# Recent changes to the EMO online service 

## August 2025 

### Licence

You will now have to upload a licence when submitting the form.

There has been feedback that forms were getting rejected without a licence attached. EMS can't process the order without a license, so wait to submit it until you have one — even if that means giving them less than 48 hours' notice.

### Exclusion zone maps

You will now be able to upload PNG's when you are adding a map to an exclusion zone.

There has been feedback that some maps are in PNG format and users were unable to upload them.

### Navigation

You will now be able to quickly check the form is correct before you submit it.

When all sections of the form are complete you will now be able to use the 'Save and go to the next section' button on the 'Check your answers' page to move to the next section's 'Check your answers' page.

## July 2025 

### Device wearer fixed address

You will now be able to see improved help text when selecting if a device wearer has a fixed address.

In most cases a fixed address is needed to process the order. If you submit an order without it your order may be rejected.

### Licence upload

You will now be able to upload larger files and Word documents when attaching a licence to an order. 
 
There has been feedback that people need to upload files bigger than 10MB so the limit has been increased to 25MB. In addition you will now be able to upload Word documents in addition to PDFs.

### Change a submitted order

The 'About the changes in this version of the form' has been updated to remove the different options that were available to select for what had changed in an order.  
 
This list of options was not fully representative of what could be changed in the form. Details of what is being changed in the order should now only be captured in the freetext box.

You can also now enter more information about of what you have changed in a text box.

This text will be sent with your changes to help the installer quickly understand what has changed and what they need to do. 

There have also been some changes to make it more obvious that you are sending a change to an order rather than a new order.

### Monitoring details

The 'Order type' field has been removed so that you do not have to select 'Post-release'. This is automatically selected for you, so it is no longer visible on the page.

The options for the question; 'Which pilot is the device wearer part of?' have been updated to make it easier to provide the relevant details.

Some options for the condition type question have been removed so now it only includes 'Licence conditions' and 'Post-sentence supervision requirement'.

### Search for a submitted order

You can now search for a form that you or somebody else has submitted by clicking the ‘Search submitted form’ button on the homescreen page.

You need to see forms that you or other people have submitted, depending on your organisation's access. In future releases you will be able to make a change to a form that you or other people have submitted.

## June 2025 

### Removing start time and end time of monitoring

You no longer need to enter the overall start time and end time of monitoring. 

There has been feedback that you don’t always know the start and end times and they are not on the licence. The installer will use 00:00 for the start time on the day monitoring starts and 23:59 for the end time on the day monitoring ends.

### Making overall end date of monitoring mandatory

You can no longer submit an EMO form without entering the overall end date of monitoring. 

Monitoring end date is needed by the installer to ensure monitoring stops at that date. It can be found on the licence.

### Making end date of monitoring for each monitoring requirement mandatory

You can no longer submit an EMO form without entering the end date for each monitoring requirement that is added. For example, Trail monitoring.

End dates are needed by the installer to ensure monitoring stops at that date. They can be found on the licence for each monitoring requirement.

### Splitting risk information question

You now need to check if there are any alerts against the device wearer and record that information in the form. If you know of any known risks at the installation address you should also select the appropriate option. 

There has been feedback that you won't always know about risks at the installation address such as dangerous animals but do know about any alerts against the device wearer such as violent behaviour. To make it easier for you to answer the risk question has been split into two questions in the service. 

### Improvement to installation address page to enable easy selection of device wearers fixed address

You can now select the device wearer’s fixed address to use as the address where installation of the electronic monitoring device will take place. 

There has been feedback that it was time consuming and onerous to manually enter the same address twice. You will now be able to select the device wearer’s address for the installation address.

### Download PDF
You can now download a PDF of your submitted form directly from the download button on the summary page.

You often need to download a copy of the form for your records and to send it to probation and police. The old process of printing to PDF and then saving that PDF was not intuitive.
