# Training and onboarding

You will move from emailing applications to using the online service to submit EMOs.  

Before your team moves over to using the online service, you’ll get an invitation to onboarding. During onboarding you’ll receive training and an account to use the online service. After onboarding and training, you can get further support via regular drop-in sessions.  

View the [timeline](#onboarding-timetable) to find out when your team will move over to using the online service. 

You must continue to send EMO application forms by email until you move to using the online service.

## Drop in sessions  

You’ll get an invitation to join online drop-in sessions once you start using the online service.  

Drop-in sessions are an opportunity for you to ask the EMO Support Team questions and get help with issues you are experiencing. You can also find out answers to questions from other online service users.
