## Get started

##Getting ready to use the CEMO online service

### Knowing when to start using the CEMO online service

You can expect a notification by email or through your line manager that you will be using the CEMO online service shortly. If you are interested in when your team is scheduled to transition, a timetable will be shared providing details on the order of teams being onboarded.

Until you receive your notification and confirmation that you are onboarded, continue to send completed document forms by email using your team's current process.

### Being supported through onboarding

You'll be supported throughout the onboarding process to help transition over to submitting notification forms online.

You will have the opportunity to attend a training webinar and join regular drop-in sessions to get help. There will also be a helpdesk available if you experience problems using the CEMO online service.

### What training is provided

You'll be invited to a webinar to find out about the CEMO online service.

During the webinar, you will be shown how to:

- Access the CEMO online service
- Log in
- Complete the online form
- Submit an electronic monitoring notification form
- Make changes to current monitoring conditions

You will also get an opportunity to ask questions and find out more about the service during the session.

### Sending completed forms by email after you are onboarded

If you have an account and have been notified to use the CEMO online service, then you must use the CEMO online service to submit forms.

If you email a completed form after your account is ready to use and you have been onboarded, you will be asked to resubmit the form via the online service.

# Getting your account set up

### Registering for an account

You don't need to register or contact us to get set up. We will create your account and provide you with login details when your account is ready.

For those from the Prison estate, you will access the service using your NOMIS or DPS credentials.

For those from the Probation estate, you will access the service using your Delius credentials.

For those from Youth Custody Services, Courts, and the Home Office, who are accessing the service without NOMIS or Delius credentials, once an administrator has created your account for you, your username will be emailed to you with a link to create a password. This will be emailed to you on the day you are onboarded to the new service.

### Setting up accounts for new joiners after your team has been onboarded

If a team member joins after your team has been onboarded to the CEMO online service, follow the guidance below to get access to the service:

#### Prison team access

Contact your Local System Administrators (LSAs) who will be able to request that a new account is created. If the request for the account creation is for a new user, your LSA will need to request for a new NOMIS account to be created, which will be reviewed and actioned by the NOMIS Application Support team. Once a NOMIS account has been created, your LSA can provide you with a CEMO Service role on the user's new DPS account.

If a member of staff with an existing NOMIS account is transferring from another prison, the user's LSA may also need to request their account is transferred to the new prison and, where necessary, provide access to the CEMO Service. The LSA can then add the relevant CEMO Service role to the new user's DPS account. More information is available here: [Local System Administrators - LSAs](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/prisons-digital/SitePages/Local-System-Adminstrators.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=ddfieD&CID=4d60ef94-7f01-4f77-b19b-e54981a84458).

#### Probation team access

The Delius Services Team will provide relevant access so new users can use the CEMO online service. Raise a request for access in the [Delius Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b). Once completed, the Delius Services Team will be in touch to confirm the next steps to access your account.

#### Youth Custody Service, Court, and Home Office employees

Contact your nominated group administration manager to request a new account is created for you.

### Removing access when someone leaves the team

If someone leaves the team after your team has been onboarded to the CEMO online service, follow the below process to remove access:

#### Prison teams

You must inform the LSA that you are leaving or no longer require access. The LSA will be able to remove access to the CEMO service.

#### Probation teams

[Needs process]

#### Youth Custody Service, Court, or Home Office

Tell your group administration manager that you are leaving or no longer require access. They will arrange for access to be removed.

*Nominated group admin manager*

Contact [Product Support] to request that your access and account are removed. Inform your team that a new group administration manager is required for the team you are responsible for.

## Logging in to your account

### How will I get a username and password?

Your login credentials to access the CEMO service will depend on which organisation you represent and submit orders from.

#### Prison employees

You can log in using your NOMIS or DPS credentials. [NOMIS credentials to log in]. If you do not have access to NOMIS, contact your Local System Administrator to raise a request... follow your usual business support model and contact the relevant HMPPS Auth Support teams to gain access.

#### Probation employee

You will need your [Delius credentials to log in]. If you do not have access to Delius, follow your usual business support model and contact the relevant HMPPS Auth Support teams to gain access.

#### Youth Custody Service, Court, and Home Office employees

Your username and password will be sent securely before you are onboarded to the service.

### Username or password isn't working

Your username and password are case-sensitive, so check:

- The spelling of your username and password is correct
- You are using uppercase and lowercase letters in the right place
- The caps lock is turned off when not needed
- You have entered symbols, numbers, or punctuation in the right place

If you are still unable to sign in, you can [recover your username](https://sign-in.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth/forgotten-username) or [create a new password](https://sign-in.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth/reset-password) to access your account.

You need the email address and access to the mailbox that your account is registered to.
