## Overview

### What is the Electronic Monitoring Order (EMO) online service?

The Electronic Monitoring Order (EMO) online service allows you to submit applications for the installation of electronic monitoring devices to meet monitoring condition requirements.

The EMO online service also allows for changes to be made to existing monitoring conditions where devices have been installed.

You can:

- Create a new application form for an EMO
- Save drafts so you can return to it when you need to
- Attach key documents such as licence documentation, maps of exclusion or inclusion zones, and photo identification
- Securely and safely submit forms to EMS electronically
- View forms that you have submitted
- Make changes to forms you have submitted

### Is the EMO online service the same as the current process?

The online service allows you to apply for an EMO through a digital form. Instead of emailing completed forms to the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS), you submit information to EMS electronically.

If you are responsible for submitting EMOs, your responsibilities and the information required will remain the same when you move to using the EMO online service.

### What changes can I expect?

We have combined all existing EMO forms into one online form, therefore there are some changes you will experience:

**One form**

All document forms have been amalgamated into one online form. There is no need to select the right form for the request you are making as you will complete the same online form for all requests.

**No need to email forms**

Once submitted, the form is electronically sent to EMS. You can also upload and submit attachments such as licences, maps of exclusion or inclusion zones, and photo identification. You will be able to download a copy of your completed form to share with your team.

**Easier to use**

A simplified layout and easy-to-understand language make the form easy to use. Clear signposting of mandatory and optional questions, as well as more closed questions (such as multiple choice), make completing the form quicker.
