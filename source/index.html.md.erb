The online service allows you to apply for installation of electronic monitoring devices. It also allows you to make changes to a submitted application form.

Use the online service to:

- submit an Electronic Monitoring Order (EMO) application form
- save draft or incomplete forms
- send attachments with application forms. For example, licence documents, maps of exclusion or inclusion zones and photo identification
- view and download completed application forms submitted by you
- make changes to submitted application forms

## The new process

EMO applications are electronically submitted through the online service. The need to email EMO application forms will shortly stop.

Using your online account you will complete a digital form. The form gives the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS) information required to install an electronic monitoring device.

The information collected in the online form is the same as in the document forms. You will submit information about the device wearer and monitoring conditions required. Supporting documents, such as a licence, can also be attached to your form.

Your responsibility to submit EMO applications forms will remain the same when moving over to use the online service.


## What changes can I expect?

You will notice changes when moving to using the online service. The main changes are:

### One form

The online service combines all existing document forms. There is one form for all new EMO applications and one process to make changes. You can upload and submit attachments to online application forms.

### Access submitted application forms

> This functionality has not yet been released. You can currently just view draft and submitted forms that have been created by you.

You will have permission to view forms submitted by you and other users. You can view, download and make changes to your forms, as well as forms submitted by others.

### Easier to use

A simplified layout and easy to understand language so the form is easy to use. Clear signposting of mandatory and optional questions so completing the form is quicker.
