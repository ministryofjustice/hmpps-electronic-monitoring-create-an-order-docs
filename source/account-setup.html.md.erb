# Account set up 


You don't need to register or contact us to get set up. We will create your account and provide details when your account is ready.

Your account will be set up as follows:

- Prison service users use National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) or Digital Prison Service (DPS) credentials to access accounts.
- Probation service users use Delius credentials to access your account.
- Youth Custody Services, Courts and Home Office service users without NOMIS or Delius credentials, will have an account set up. You'll get an email with a username and instructions to create a password when your account is ready.


## Setting up accounts for new joiners

If someone new joins your team after onboarding, you can get them an account set up. Follow the guidance below to get them access to the online service:

### Prison teams

Contact your Local System Administrator (LSA) to request a new account.

The LSA will request a new NOMIS account if required.

If the new user has transferred from another team, the LSA will transfer the NOMIS account.

### Probation teams

Raise a request in the [Delius Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b) for access to the online service. The Delius Services Team will provide next steps to get the new user set up.

### Youth Custody Services, Courts and Home Office teams

Contact your nominated group administration manager. You need to request a new account for the new user.


## Removing access when someone leaves the team

Remove access if someone leaves the team after onboarding. Follow the below guidance to remove access:

### Prison teams

Contact the LSA to request removal of access. The LSA will remove access so the user can no longer use the online service.

### Probation teams

On the Delius Technology Portal, complete the [amendment form](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b) to remove access.

### Youth Custody Services, Courts or Home Office teams

Contact your group administration manager to remove access.

### Nominated group admin managers

Email Product Support to remove access.
