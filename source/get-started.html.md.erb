# Get started

## When to use the online service

You will get a notification by email or through your line manager. You'll get onboarding information and a start date for using the online service.

Until you receive your notification, continue to send EMO application forms by email. You should follow your team's process for submitting application forms by email.


## Timetable for teams to get set up

This is the scheduled timetable for services to move to using the online service:

- Prison services move to the online service from Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup> March
- Youth Services move to the online service from Tuesday 15<sup>th</sup> April
- Probation services move to the online service from Tuesday 29<sup>th</sup> April
- Courts move to the online service from Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> May
- Home Office teams will move to the online service from Tuesday 10<sup>th</sup> June

The date provided is when your service starts onboarding. You may be onboarded on or after this date. You'll get an email notification nearer the time to confirm your onboarding date.


## Training

You'll get an invitation to attend a training webinar. Attend the webinar to find out about the EMO online service and how to use it.

Topics covered in the webinar include:

- accessing the EMO online service
- logging in to your account
- completing the EMO application form
- viewing draft and submitted EMO application forms
- making changes to submitted forms

You will also get an opportunity to ask questions in the webinar.


## Drop-in sessions

Online drop-in sessions are available for you to ask questions and get help. You will get dates and times for drop-in sessions during onboarding. They are a great opportunity to find out answers to questions from other users too.


## When to stop emailing forms

Use the EMO online service once you have access to your account. Do not email EMO forms by email if your account is working and ready to use.

It is important to use the online service so you and other users can view and make changes to your submitted forms. Forms submitted by email are not uploaded to the online service so aren't viewable.

If you need to make changes to a form submitted by email, you can do this using the online service. If a form does not come up in search results, follow the steps on the search page to make changes.

If the online service isn't working or your form fails to submit, use the guidance in the [Problems with submitting forms section](#problems-with-submitting-forms).
