# Logging in to your account  

You need an account to submit EMO application forms through the online service.  

You need one of the following:  

- a NOMIS or DPS account if you work Prison Service 

- a Delius account if you work in Probation Service 

- a username and password if you work for the Youth Custody Service, Court or Home Office 

## Can’t log in  

If you can’t log in to your account, or are experiencing issues logging in: 

- contact your LSA if you are a NOMIS account user   

- use the [Technology Portal](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=21952b8edb73e7441b4ffc45ae96197b) if you are a Delius account user  

- try recovering your username  or creating a new password if you use a username and password to log in 

If you are a NOMIS or Delius account user and continue to experience logging in issues, contact the Electronic Monitoring Support Team on 0800 917 5148.
