# Logging in to your account

You will need an [account set up](/account-setup.html) to access the online service.

Once set up, use the guidance below to log in to your account:

### Prison teams

Use your NOMIS or DPS credentials to log in.

### Probation teams

Use your Delius credentials to log in.

### Youth Custody Services, Courts and Home Office teams

Use the username sent by email during onboarding and the password you set up.


## Username or password isn't working

If your username or password are not working, check:

- the spelling of your username and password is correct
- you are using uppercase and lowercase letters in the right place
- the caps lock is off when not needed
- if using symbols, numbers or punctuation, it is in the right place

If you are still unable to sign in, you can [recover your username](https://sign-in.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth/forgotten-username) or [create a new password](https://sign-in.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth/reset-password) to access your account. You need the email address for the registered account as you'll get an email to help resolve the problem.
