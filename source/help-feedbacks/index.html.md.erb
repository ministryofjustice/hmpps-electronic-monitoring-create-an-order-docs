# Help and feedback

## Help and support

Ahead of your team being onboarded to the CEMO online service, you will be invited to webinars to get an overview of the new service with step-by-step instructions for how to login, complete and submit the new form.

You will also be invited to optional drop-in sessions. These will be held in the first few weeks of your team being onboarded to the new service. In the sessions, you can raise and listen to questions asked to the CEMO Product Team. It is recommended to attend if you are unsure of how to use the CEMO online service or generally would like to discuss any issues or thoughts on the service and process itself.

For Prison users encountering problems logging in, you can contact their LSA or contact the help desk on [0800 917 5148](tel:08009175148).

For Probation users encountering problems logging in, you can contact the help desk on [(include number for help desk)].

For all other users, you can contact the EMO Product Team to request support. Please follow the 'Reporting a problem' guidance below for more information.

## Reporting a problem
