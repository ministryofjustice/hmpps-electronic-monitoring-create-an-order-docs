# New EMO application forms 

To start a new application form, [log in](/logging-in.html) to your account and click ‘start new form.’  

You need the following information to complete an EMO application form:  

- Notifying and Responsible Organisation information such as information about your team and other supporting services  

- personal information about the device wearer. For example, full name, date of birth and identity numbers  

- contact information for the device wearer. For example, addresses for monitoring purposes and telephone number  

- electronic monitoring conditions including the electronic monitoring required and requirements  

- risk information to help with installation of electronic monitoring devices 

You do not need to complete the form in one attempt, you can save EMO application forms in draft and return to it. 

## Starting a new EMO application form 

Log in to your account and click on the 'start new form' button. 

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete all sections of the form. Questions include hints to help provide the correct answer. If you click 'save and continue' but can't move on to the next page, check all mandatory questions have been answered. There are error messages to help. Complete optional questions if you have the information as this will help EMS with installation. 

Before submitting your form, check your answers and attachments are correct.

## Adding attachments 

There is an option to add attachments at the end of the online form. You can attach files such as a copy of the licence, a map or photo. 

If you have a copy of the licence you should always attach it, this will help reduce any further clarifications to be raised and ensure a seamless processing of a new order.

The licence must be less than 25mb in size and a: 

- pdf 

- doc

- docx


## Saving a draft 

When you have an application form open, click on 'save and return to main form menu.' 

Your draft form is saved in the 'your draft forms' tab on the home screen. 

To return to your draft application form, look for the device wearer's name or date you last opened the form. 

You can only view your own drafts. You can't view someone else's draft application forms. 

## View submitted forms 

You can view forms submitted by yourself or someone else.  

Enter the device wearer's name and identity number in search. Find the form in the search results to view and download the form. 

If the form is not listed in search results, it may be an [emailed form](/stopping-email-applications.html#accessing-forms-already-submitted-by-email) so not available online. 

## Sending a submitted form to other interested parties

The form is only sent to EMS and not sent to other interested parties such as the police or probation.

You can view and download a form you have submitted from the confirmation page or from your homescreen and email it to the interested parties.
